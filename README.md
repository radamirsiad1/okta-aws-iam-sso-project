# Okta + AWS IAM Identity Center SSO Integration (SAML 2.0)

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Okta** with **AWS IAM Identity Center** (formerly AWS SSO) using **SAML 2.0** for federated Single Sign-On (SSO).

## 🔍 Overview
The goal of this lab was to configure Okta as the **Identity Provider (IdP)** and AWS IAM Identity Center as the **Service Provider (SP)**, enabling secure authentication into AWS using Okta credentials.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps
- Created test users and groups in Okta (Alice Johnson, Bob Miller)
- Enforced MFA through Okta authentication policies
- Added and configured the **AWS IAM Identity Center** application in Okta
- Established trust between Okta and AWS via SAML
- Verified access by signing into AWS through the Okta user dashboard
- Documented the entire process with step-by-step screenshots
